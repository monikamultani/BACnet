# Chat Applikation Sketch
Author: Li Ting Luong, Monika Multani

## Extend Chat
Our group is working at the existing chat. We extended the chat with a sketch application. We still need to debug the application. 
In addition we started to extend the chat with forwarding message.

### Sketch Application
We added a "Sketch" - button. By pressing the button a new window opens. Here it is possible to create a sketch. There is a color palette to change the color of the pen and a scale bar to resize the pen. The background color can be changed by clicking on the color and then on the bucket. 
A part or all of the content can be removed with the help of the eraser.

### Forwarding Message
We would also like to add the ability to forward message including reference to the original author. 

## Tools
The code is written in python. We used the inbuilt python module Tkinter which is used to create GUI applications.

## Run the Application
First follow the steps from the BACnet/20-fs-ias-lec/groups/14-feedCtrl. After executing the file feed_control.py, go to the BACnet/20-fs-ias-lec/groups/03-subChat and follow the steps in their README.md file. Our Extension is included directly in the subjective_chat.py file. There is no need to install anything else because we used Tkinter as well, which should be already installed by following the steps of the group 03 from 2020-fs-ias-lec.
